# Crypto-Notifier

Simple python script to check my cryptocurrency balances from Bittrex using their API, along with CoinMarketCap API and compare them to how much I have invested. Also uses Twilio to text me if my percentage gain changes within 10% of the last time it ran. I run this using a cronjob on my Rasberry Pi.
